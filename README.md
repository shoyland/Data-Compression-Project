# Data-Compression-Project
Research project on sparse stochastic gradient descent using distributed computing.
R file contains functions for batch stochastic gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, distributed stochastic gradient descent, and distributed sparse stochastic gradient descent.
The functions were run on the s&p 500 stock market data from the ISLR library.
